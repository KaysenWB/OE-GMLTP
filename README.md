# OE-GMLTP
Ship trajectory prediction in long-term multi-ship scenarios. Implemented by Multi-Graph Convolutional Network (MGSC) and probabilistic sparse self-attention mechanism (Probsparse attention).

The implementation code for this paper is Graph-driven Multi-vessel Long-term Trajectories Prediction for Route Planning under Complex Waters.
